NAME: Math Lee L. Biacolo

COURSE & YEAR: BSIT-3

Hi everyone, my name is Math Lee L. Biacolo, and I'm excited to be part of this course! I'm from Minglanilla, and I'm currently enrolled in the BSIT program at CIT-U. What I really like about the field of IT is my interest with technology, both the older systems and the cutting-edge innovations. It's something that constantly impress me. Outside of academics, I spend a lot of time on my computer, whether it's for programming projects, keeping my schedule organized, or just relaxing with some video games or movies.
